## About SQLite Archive Files

See https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html

## Status

[`v0.2.0`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/sqlar@v0.2.0) should be production ready.

The implementation of [`sqlarfs`](https://pkg.go/dev/github.com/dolmen-go/sqlar/sqlarfs) is quite
naive so far:
  * the DB is queried on every directory read, almost without caching (`v0.2.0`` has only a cache for [FileInfo](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs.FileInfo) of directory entries).
  * file data is entirely read in memory on first read of a file.
  * reading file data is done purely through the SQL layer via the
    [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) package. The C implementation of
    SQLite has a [BLOB API](https://sqlite.org/c3ref/blob_open.html) but we aren't using it.

So it is not yet recommended for thousands of files (but not yet really tested).
Reports of performance issues and use cases are very welcome.
