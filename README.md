# sqlar - Go libraries for [SQLite Archive Files](https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html)

## About SQLite Archive Files

See https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html

## Status

v0.2.0 should be production ready.

The implementation of [sqlarfs](https://pkg.go/dev/github.com/dolmen-go/sqlar/sqlarfs) is quite
naive so far: the DB is queried on every directory read, without caching. So it is not yet recommended
for thousands of files, but not yet really tested. Reports of performance issues and use cases are very welcome.

## Doc

Package [github.com/dolmen-go/sqlar/sqlarfs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolmen-go/sqlar/sqlarfs) implements interface
[io/fs.FS](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS).
